# Code Review – Maia Policy (Prompt)

Review the diff according to Maia policy:
- Correctness first; highlight logic risks and unhandled cases.
- Security-by-default issues (secrets, validation, privilege).
- Maintainability: small pure helpers, logging, tests.
- Concrete suggestions with code snippets.
