# Maia Web Rules
- Next.js (App Router) + Tailwind, TypeScript strict.
- Prefer React Server Components; mark client components explicitly.
- Keep components <150 lines; extract UI to /components.
- Tests: Vitest + Testing Library (happy + edge).
- Commands:
  - dev: npm --prefix apps/web run dev
  - build: npm --prefix apps/web run build
  - test: npm --prefix apps/web test
